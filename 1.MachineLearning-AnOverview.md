The goal of machine learning is to teach a machine to learn based on the input they receive from the Environment. Tom Mitchell in 1997 defines machine learning as the ability for a machine to gain expertise on a particular task based on experience.

### How do we assess learning?
Assume a teacher teaches a physics class for three months, and at the end of the lecture sessions, the teacher administers a test to ascertain if the student has learned.

Let us consider two different sub-plots:
1. The teacher tests the student with an exact word for word replica of questions that he used as examples while teaching.
2. The teacher evaluates the student with an entirely different but similar problem set based on the principles taught in class.
In which of the subplots can the teacher be confident that the student has learned?

**Norms of Learning**
1. **Memorization:** In the first subplot, it is erroneous for the teacher to form a basis for learning because the student has seen and most likely memorized the examples during the training phase. Memorization is the act of mastering and storing a pattern for future recollection. Therefore it is inaccurate to use training samples to carry out learning evaluation. In machine learning, this is also known as data snooping.
2. **Generalization:** In the second sub-scenario, the teacher can be confident that the assessment acts as a conclusive test to ascertain if the student has learned anything over the course of the lectures. The ability for the student to extrapolate using the principles taught in class to solve new examples is known as Generalization.
Hence, we can conclude that learning is the ability to generalize to new cases.
