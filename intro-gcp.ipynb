    "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a wide range of services for securing, storing, serving and analyzing data. These cloud services form a secure cloud perimeter for data, where different operations and transformations can be carried out on the data without it ever leaving the cloud ecosystem.\n",

    "GCP is a simple, yet powerful, and cost effective cloud option for building large-scale machine learning models. It boasts a rich set of products to simplify the process of performaing large-scale data analytics, model training and model deployment for inference on the cloud."

    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">Long training times:</span> Running a suite of an experiment on a decent CPU (e.g., a QuadCore i7, with 8GB RAM) can take upwards of 3 hours to days and even weeks for the algorithms to converge and produce a result set.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">ML modeling is iterative:</span> This computational lag is especially dire because getting a decent result requires several iterations of experiments either to tune the different parameters of the algorithm or to carry out various forms of feature engineering to achieve the desired classifier/ model that generalizes \"optimally\" to new examples.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">High-performant computer hardware is expensive:</span> On-premise high-end machines are expensive. Moreover, the technical skills required to build a cluster of commodity machines running a Spark/Hadoop cluster might be overwhelming and even sometimes a distraction from the ML task.\n",

The aforementioned products generate, store and process tons of Terabytes of data each day from internet users around the world.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">Taming big data:</span> To deal with this significant data, Google have massive investments in processing and storage research and infrastructure. Google as of today boasts some of the most impressive data center designs in the world to support their computational demands and computing services.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">High-speed computation:</span> Google Cloud Platform makes available to the public lighting fast computational speed (it is getting faster!) and high-tech storage capabilities with extremely low latency (meaning minimal delays in data transfer) and high throughput (can be naively described as the time taken to complete a job). This is all glued together by state of the art networking technology/ infrastructure.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:blue; font-weight:bold;\">Ease of use:</span> The storage and processing platform on which are built products like Gmail, Google Docs and the like, are now accessible to the public and available for everyone to utilize.\n",
